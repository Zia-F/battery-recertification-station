# Battery Recertification Station

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a battery recertification station designed specifically for Trexe Robotics. The purpose of this station is to accurately measure and recertify the capacity of NiCAD batteries. The code in this repository is tailored to run on an Odroid C4, a powerful and energy-efficient single-board computer.

Features:

- Capacity Measurement: The recertification station utilizes advanced techniques to accurately measure the capacity of NiCAD batteries. This ensures that the batteries meet the required specifications and can be safely used in Trexe Robotics' applications.
- User-Friendly Interface: The recertification station includes an intuitive user interface that allows operators to easily initiate the recertification process, monitor progress, and view detailed reports of battery capacity.
- Data Logging: All recertification results are logged and stored in a structured format, enabling easy retrieval and analysis of battery performance over time.
- Customizable Parameters: The code provides flexibility to adjust various parameters such as voltage thresholds and charge/discharge times, allowing customization to meet specific requirements or battery models.
